## Environment Variables

```bash
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

   - Modal handles submission
   - Success toast on submission

2. **UserDashboard.jsx**

   - Full-width layout

---

## Admin Panel Integration (Required)

### Admin Dashboard Needs:
Create an admin panel page with:

1. **Pending Deposits List:**
   ```javascript
   GET /api/admin/deposits?status=pending
   ```

2. **Verify Button:**
   ```javascript
   POST /api/deposit/verify
   Body: { depositId, action: "verify" }
   ```

3. **Reject Button with Reason Input:**
   ```javascript
   POST /api/deposit/verify
   Body: { depositId, action: "reject", rejectionReason: "..." }
   ```

4. **View All Deposits:**
   ```javascript
   GET /api/admin/deposits
   ```

### Example Admin Endpoint (Create if needed):
```javascript
// src/app/api/admin/deposits/route.js
export async function GET(request) {
  // Check admin authentication
  // Query deposits with filters
  // Return deposits with user details
}
```

---

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication:**
   - All endpoints require valid JWT token
   - Verify endpoint requires admin role

2. **Validation:**
   - Amount must be positive number
   - Transaction ID is required
   - Payment method must be valid enum value

3. **Email Security:**
   - Uses Resend API with API key
   - Email addresses validated

4. **Data Protection:**
   - Sensitive data (transaction IDs) stored securely
   - Payment proof URLs should be validated
