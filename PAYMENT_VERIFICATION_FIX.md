# Payment Verification System - Fixed & Enhanced

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Plan Enum Validation Error**
**Problem:** The User model had a strict enum validation for the `plan` field that only allowed `["Free", "Standard", "Pro", "Premium"]`, but the pricing system was sending plan names like `"Plan 1"`, `"Plan 2"`, etc.

**Error Message:**
```
Error: User validation failed: plan: `Plan 1` is not a valid enum value for path `plan`.
```

**Solution:**
- Removed the enum restriction from the `plan` field in `userModel.js`
- Changed from:
  ```javascript
  plan: {
    type: String,
    enum: ["Free", "Standard", "Pro", "Premium"],
    default: "Free",
  }
  ```
- To:
  ```javascript
  plan: {
    type: String,
    default: "Free",
  }
  ```
- Added `planDetails` object to store additional plan information (price, cashback, dailyReturn, purchaseDate)
