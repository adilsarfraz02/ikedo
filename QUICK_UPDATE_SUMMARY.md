## ✅ NEW: Username-Based Referral Links

### Before:
```
https://yourdomain.com/auth/signup?ref=a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890
```

### After:
```

```

### How It Works:
1. Takes username (e.g., "John Doe")

3. Removes special characters: "john doe"
4. Replaces spaces with hyphens: "john-doe"
5. Adds 6-char unique ID: "john-doe-x7k2p9"

### Examples:
- "Alice Smith" → `alice-smith-a8b3c1`
- "Bob_123!" → `bob-123-k5m7n2`
- "User@2024" → `user2024-d9e4f2`

## ✅ NEW: Referral Link Display
- Shows in the main balance card (gradient blue-purple)
- Copy button with one click
- Toast notification on copy
- Always visible for easy sharing
