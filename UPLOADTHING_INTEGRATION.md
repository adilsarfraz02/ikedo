## 🔄 Upload Flow

### User Journey:
1. User clicks "Deposit" button
2. Modal opens with deposit form
3. User fills amount, payment method, transaction ID
4. **Upload Section:**
   - User drags screenshot OR clicks "Choose File"
   - File uploads to UploadThing servers
   - Progress toast shows "Uploading screenshot..."
   - On success: Preview appears with checkmark
   - On error: Error toast shows
5. User can:
   - View full image (opens in new tab)
   - Remove image (X button)
   - Re-upload different image
6. User clicks "Submit Deposit Request"
7. Validation checks if screenshot is uploaded
8. If yes: Submits to API
9. If no: Shows error "Please upload payment proof screenshot"

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### UploadThing Configuration:
```typescript
// src/lib/uploadthing.ts
export const ourFileRouter = {
  imageUploader: f({ image: { maxFileSize: "8MB" } })
    .onUploadComplete(({ file }) => {
      console.log("File uploaded:", file);
    }),
} satisfies FileRouter;
```

### API Route:
```javascript
// src/app/api/uploadthing/route.js
export const { GET, POST } = createNextRouteHandler({
  router: ourFileRouter,
});
```

### Component Integration:
```jsx
import { UploadDropzone } from "@/lib/uploadthing";

<UploadDropzone
  endpoint="imageUploader"
  onClientUploadComplete={(res) => {
    const url = res[0].url;
    onUploadComplete(url);
  }}
  onUploadBegin={() => {
    toast.loading("Uploading...", { id: "upload" });
  }}
  onUploadError={(error) => {
    toast.error("Upload failed", { id: "upload" });
  }}
/>
```

---

## 🎯 Validation

### Client-Side Validation:
```javascript
if (!depositForm.paymentProof) {
  toast.error("Please upload payment proof screenshot");
  return;
}
```

### Server-Side Validation:
```javascript
// Deposit model
paymentProof: {
  type: String,
  required: true, // Enforced at database level
}
