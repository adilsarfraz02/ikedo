## 🎨 Visual Comparison

### BEFORE (URL Input):
```javascript
<Input
  type="url"
  label="Payment Proof URL (Optional)"
  placeholder="Enter image URL of payment slip"
  value={depositForm.paymentProof}
  onChange={(e) => handleInputChange("paymentProof", e.target.value)}
  description="Upload your payment slip to an image hosting service and paste the URL"
/>
```

/>
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Direct upload from device
- ✅ Drag & drop + click to browse
